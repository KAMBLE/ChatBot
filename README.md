# My Data Science Journey 
I have been working on Data since starting of my career and this portfolio is created to understand , explore real world data science problems .
Another purpose to create this portfolio is to learn variety of data science problems and to make myself capable of handling data science challenges in Industry !

## Contetnts

* [Toxic Comments Classification](https://github.com/KAMBLE/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/toxic%20comments%20classification%20.ipynb): Challenged to build a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate better than Perspective’s current models. Dataset is consist of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits.
